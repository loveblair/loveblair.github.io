       <h1 style="color:rgb(255,0,0)">Red</h1>
       <p1 style="color:rgb(255,0,0)">Red can bring a feeling of excitement and when placed strategically, can be a call to action that causes a user to buy.</p1>
        <h1 style="color:rgb(240,143,23)">Orange</h1>
         <p1 style="color:rgb(240,143,23)">I think orange can evoke respect and trust. Especially, when it is paired with blue. It's worth noting that some studies show this as a least favorite color among both men and women.</p1>
       <h1 style="color:rgb(240,255,23)">Yellow</h1>
         <p1 style="color:rgb(240,255,23)">Yellow is a cheerful color but too much of it can be jarring to the eyes. It's a happy color, but creates a strong, not-so-fun contrast.</p1>
       <h1 style="color:rgb(34,148,39)">Green</h1>
         <p1 style="color:rgb(34,148,39)">Green is a favorable color. You notice a lot of organic brands being in green. It reminds me of greenery and money. </p1>
       <h1 style="color:rgb(34,68,240)">Blue</h1>
         <p1 style="color:rgb(34,68,240)">Blue evokes a sense of trust and loyalty It feels serene when you look at it. </p1>
       <h1 style="color:rgb(102,24,148)">Purple</h1>
         <p1 style="color:rgb(102,24,148)">Purple feels comforting and regal. I like purple. It is almost my favorite color. Most women find the color purple attractive.</p1>
       <h1 style="color:rgb(0,0,0)">Black</h1>
         <p1 style="color:rgb(0,0,0)">Is dark and serious. It is very conventional and classic. What is even better is it shows up nicely against white background.</p1>
        <h1 style="color:rgb(255,12,157)">Pink</h1>
        <p1 style="color:rgb(255,12,157)">Pink is a color that is soft, assured and friendly. It is my favorite color. I read somewhere that pink is the least favorite color among males.</p1>
