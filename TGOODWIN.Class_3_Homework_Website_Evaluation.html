            Please choose 3 websites you visit frequently and state 
            what you like and dislike about each of the 3. 

            Try to use some of the new terms & ideas you have learned
            in class.

            Additionally, for each site answer the following questions:
<h3>www.facebook.com</h3>
<p1><b>Primary color:</b> Blue.</p1>
<p2><b>Does the mood of the color match the site's purpose?:</b> Yes. Blue can be percieved as calm and trusting which could make a person less hesitant to connect with strangers.</p2> 
<p3><b>Primary users of the site?:</b> Millienials and Gen. Xers</p3>   
<p4><b>Does the web design cater to the user base?:</b> In general yes, it is very busy, chaotic, and encourages user engagement.</p4>
<p5> <b>Users' tasks and goals for visiting the site?:</b> business engagement and feeding personal, at times narcissistic interests. Sorry about that last part, but you asked... </p5>
<p6><b>Is this task/goal easy to accomplish or find?:</b> Absolutely. You can paint whatever picture you want for your audience.</p6> 
<p7><b>Does the site succeed in providing a great user experience:</b> Yes. My 90-year old grandmother has a Facebook page and while we post for her, she gets the gist of it...and HATES Facebook by the way. Also, Facebook has ongoing tutorial posts that help to enhance the users knowledge of the site's features. It is very useful and they do a great job of presenting the information in a non-intrusive way.</p7>
<p8>Likes/Dislikes: It's Facebook and I have a love/hate relationship anyway. I suppose my complaints are more social media specific and have nothing to do with design. Don't hate the player, hate the game.</p8>
<h3>www.centrisfcu.org</h3>
<p1><b>Primary color:</b> Purple.</p1>
<p2><b>Does the mood of the color match the site's purpose?:</b> Honestly, I think some marketing team member said, 'purple'. I think purple can be exciting and regal, but I'm not sure it is the perfect banking color. It does attract a lot of women. </p2> 
<p3><b>Primary users of the site?:</b> Anyone 18 and over.</p3> 
<p4><b>Does the web design cater to the user base?:</b> Not really...it probably caters more to women.</p4>
<p5> <b>Users' tasks and goals for visiting the site?:</b> managing their finances. </p5>
<p6><b>Is this task/goal easy to accomplish or find?:</b> Minus the weird, but SUPER secure login process, absolutely!</p6> 
<p7><b>Does the site succeed in providing a great user experience:</b> Yes. They do an especially good job of showcasing their member benefits and seem to project an image of taking special interest in their customers.</p7>
<p8>Likes/Dislikes: I like it with exception to the weird sign-on benchmarks. You have to choose a username that is not connected to your own name and then you have an image. It's a little over the top, but I guess its more secure.</p8>
        <h3>foundationsclass.online</h3>
<p1><b>Primary color:</b> Dark Gray.</p1>
<p2><b>Does the mood of the color match the site's purpose?:</b> It doesn't evoke a ton of emotion, but gives an overall serious, focused, non-intimidating tone. </p2> 
<p3><b>Primary users of the site?:</b> Interface Web School students and teachers.</p3> 
<p4><b>Does the web design cater to the user base?:</b> Since I'm not a teacher, I can't speak for teachers, but it works especially well for students. It is very user friendly and you can get where you need to go within 3 clicks or less. My kind of web design!</p4>
<p5> <b>Users' tasks and goals for visiting the site?:</b> Learning and communicating with their teacher.</p5>
<p6><b>Is this task/goal easy to accomplish or find?:</b> Yes. The icons are great!</p6> 
<p7><b>Does the site succeed in providing a great user experience:</b> Yes. Again, the icons are great!</p7>
        <p8>Likes/Dislikes: It gets the job done, so I like it and have no complaints.</p8>
